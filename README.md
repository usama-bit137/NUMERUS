# NUMERUS (NUmerical MEthods foR Undergraduate Scientists)

**MAKE SURE YOUR READ THE `COLLABORATE.md` file before starting**

Basic rundown of the project:

### 0. Introduction âœ…

    Rationale for this resource:
    - Quick demo of Python and playthrough using some examples literally copy and paste.
    - Encouraged to break the code, you can always start again.
    - Play around with the code and see what you can screw up.

### 1. Crash Course in Python

    a. Introduction to Python, what it is and how to use it:
    - definition of python âœ…
    - data types (`int`, `string`, `dict`...) ðŸŸ¨
    - definitions of data-types and important methods
    - conditional logic, loops (`for`, `while`), useful operators etc.
    - methods and functions (built-in and custom)
    - classes
    - OOP (object-oriented programming) ?
    - decorators
    - generators

    b. Important python packages (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`,`pandas`...)
    - introduction to numpy and matplotlib (pyplot) docs
    - using scipy for integration and differentiation

    c. Modules and organising file structure.

### 2. Simple Numerical Methods:

    Solving Equations using numerical methods
    - Rearranging equations âœ…
    - linear interpolation ðŸŸ¥
    - Binary Chopping ðŸŸ¨
    - Newton-Raphson Method
    - Iteration

### 3. Advanced Numerical Methods:

    Integration and differentiation
    - Trapezium Rule
    - Simpson's Rule
    - Monte-Carlo Method
    - Finite-Difference
    - Differential Equations
    - Difference Equations
    - Taylor Series Solution
    - Runge-Kutta Method
    - Isoclines
    - Higher-order Equations
    - PDES?

### 4. Extreme Numerical Methods

    - Fourier/Laplace Transforms
    - Fast-Fourier Transform

### 5. Data Structures and Algorithms

    General Overview of Computer Science Methods:
    - Hash Maps
    - Sorting Algorithms
    - Recursive Methods

### Some projects for fun...

    - we can figure some cool stuff out later.
    - Basic Git/Github to present projects.
