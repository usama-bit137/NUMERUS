    "# 1.0 Introduction to Python3\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section, we introduce the concepts of basic python data structures, operations, conditionals and loops. This should get you up to speed on the basic methods which we will often use in the rest of the textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.0.0 What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a **high-level**, **dynamically-typed**, **object-oriented programming** (OOP) language. There's a lot to decontruct here, so let's define precisely what these terms mean. This will allow us to weigh some pros and cons of python as a programming language and why it should be your first language...\n",
    "\n",
    "- **high-level** - a high-level programming language is one that is highly abstracted from machine code. Key data structures in high-level languages include variables, arrays, objects and boolean expressions (`true`/`false`). Conversely, low-level languages are ones that are closer to binary machine code. Low-level languages are commonly more efficient that high-level languages, but we trade that efficiency for ease of readbility, learning and understanding. **{TALK ABOUT GARBAGE COLLECTORS}**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **dynamically-typed** - dynamically-typed languages are ones where the developer does not need declare what **type** a variable should have upon definition. The Python compiler (at runtime) will figure out what certain variables should be (`int`, `array`...). The next section will dive deeply into the different data types present in python. This is a bit of a catch 22, because while dynamic-typing makes python easier to use for beginners, the type of a variable can sometimes change during the course of a calculation (for example, an array can become a tuple) which can be a nightmare to debug, however, we will find fixes for these problems throughout the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **object-oriented** - an object-oriented programming (OOP) language is one that is based on the concept of *objects*. An object is a data structure which contains data. Many variable types that appear in Python (integers, arrays, matrices, dictionaries) are objects. Common OOPs include: Python, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, MATLAB and many more...\n",
    "\n",
    "Nice, so we have a better understanding of the definition of python, however, some of these terms have been loosely defined, the contents therein are sufficient for us to start using python. If you would like better definitions for some of these terms, this is an opportunity to perhaps search for some resources... \n",
    "\n",
    "With this definition in hand, we can see that Python is a good mix of all the best things we need for programming. It is human-readable (high-level), extremely versatile (from OOP) and easy to write (dynamically-typed). Don't worry if you don't understand this definition... it's more of a nice to have and may serve you well later on in your career as a python developer or if you want to learn other languages in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we shall dive into some basics of python and introduce data types in python. "
