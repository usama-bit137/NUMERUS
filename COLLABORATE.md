# How to collaborate...

## Some steps to follow:

1. Open up a new terminal on your machine. Type the following command in the terminal

```
$ git pull origin main
```

this will fetch all code from `remote` and merges into the `main` branch

3. Next we will

```
$git checkout -b <YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>
```

this will create a new branch for you that you will be able to edit the files.

4. Edit the files as you wish...

5. Once you have finished adding and editting files, you need to stage your changes, type the following command in your teminal:

```
$git add <NAME OF FILE TO STAGE>
```

6. Then we need to write a commit message - describe what you did:

```
$git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE"
```

7. Push your changes to your branch, not the `main` branch:

```
$git push origin <YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>
```

## USEFUL TIPS

- Always remember to pull from the main branch when you start working on a new bit.
- Also have fun!
